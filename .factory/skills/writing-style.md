# Writing Style Guide

Guidelines for clear, vigorous prose on samfitz.nyc.

## Core Principles

**Cut ruthlessly.** Every word must earn its place. If a sentence works without a word, delete the word. If a paragraph works without a sentence, delete the sentence.

**Use active voice.** Put the actor before the action. "I use Capacities" not "Capacities is used by me."

**Be specific.** Swap abstractions for examples. Name the tool, cite the number, describe the specific workflow.

**One idea per paragraph.** Open with a topic sentence. Let each paragraph advance a single step.

## Words and Phrases to Avoid

### Intensifiers (almost always delete)
- actually, really, very, quite, genuinely, truly, incredibly, extremely

### Filler phrases (rewrite or cut)
- "in order to" → "to"
- "the fact that" → cut entirely
- "it is important to note that" → just state the thing
- "at the end of the day" → cut
- "when it comes to" → cut

### Tech clichés (find fresher language)
- friction point
- context switching
- value add
- leverage (as verb)
- paradigm shift
- seamless
- robust
- scalable (unless literal)
- synergy

### Weak openers (rewrite)
- "What makes X different is..."
- "This is what a good Y looks like..."
- "There are..."
- "It is..."

## Structure

- **H1**: 10 words or fewer, states key tension or idea
- **H2**: Section headers, sentence case
- **H3**: Subsection headers with decorative element (from CSS)

Use `<mark>` sparingly—only for genuinely key phrases that deserve visual weight.

Use sidenotes for asides that would interrupt the main argument. The sidenote should add context, not repeat what's in the main text.

## The Tests

### Four-Question Test
Before publishing, ask:
1. Is it clear?
2. Is it concise?
3. Is it insightful?
4. Is it compelling?

### Blurry Eyes Test
Skim the piece quickly. Whatever you skip over or find your eyes glazing past—cut it.

### LA Story Test
On final pass, skim at speed. The first thing that catches your eye but doesn't advance the argument—remove it.

## Grammar Notes

- Use Oxford comma
- Use em dashes (—) without spaces for breaks in thought
- Use en dashes (–) for ranges
- Spell out 0–9, numerals for 10+
- Treat "data" as singular ("data is")

## Voice

Write as yourself—an optimistic person sharing tools and ideas you genuinely care about. Avoid corporate-speak. Be conversational but precise.

Bold claims are fine if you can back them up. Don't hedge with qualifiers.
