          <p>
            AI-generated content on
            <a href="https://medium.com" target="blank">Medium</a> surged from
            1.8% in 2022 to 37% in 2024.
            <span class="sidenote-anchor"
              >Similarly, quora saw an increase from 2 to 39% during the same
              period.</span

          <p>
            we aren't just living alongside ai anymore. we're living
            <strong><em>through it.</em></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The conventional narrative frames this as competition--AI vs. human
            creators, chatbots vs. search engines, automation vs. authenticity.
            But the real story here is more troubling: AI isn't just creating
            content, it's becoming the intermediary that controls what
            information we consume. In the new landscape, independent websites
            and
            <span class="sidenote-anchor"> "The Small Web" </span>
            <span class="sidenote">
              This term was coined by <a href="https://benhoyt.com">Ben Hoyt</a>
            </span>
            aren't just nice to have, they're as relevant as ever for preserving
            human connection and discovery in an increasingly abstracted world.

          <p>
            the mechanism is subtle but systematic. ai doesn't simply compete
            with human-created content, it intercepts and repackages it, keeping
            users within controlled ecosystems.
