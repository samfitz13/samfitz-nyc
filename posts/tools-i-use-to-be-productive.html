            Every tool here solves a problem I have—not a hypothetical problem, not a problem I'd have if I reorganized my workflow. A <mark>real problem</mark>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best tools disappear. You stop noticing them. Everything else is noise.

          <h2>Notes & Tasks</h2>
          <p>
            <strong><a href="https://capacities.io">Capacities</a></strong> handles both. I arrived here after years of searching: Apple Notes → Notion → Obsidian → Capacities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Capacities takes an <em>object-oriented approach</em>. Instead of treating every note as a blank page, I define types with structured fields. A "Book" has author, year, and status. A "Project" has deadline, priority, and related notes. Each type enforces its schema, so I filter and sort without tagging discipline.<span class="sidenote-anchor"></span>
            <span class="sidenote">Notion and Obsidian can do this, but you build and maintain the structure yourself. Capacities makes structure first-class.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Capacities recently added native task management, which let me drop a separate task app. <mark>One tool beats two</mark>—not because consolidation is inherently good, but because my notes and tasks are tightly coupled.

            <dd>
              For anything shared externally. Not because they're best, but because they're universal. When collaborating, the other person's tool preferences matter more than yours.<span class="sidenote-anchor"></span>
              <span class="sidenote">Path of least resistance. Fighting over tools wastes energy that should go toward the work.</span>

            <dd>
              For internal company documentation. The database features work well for knowledge management at scale—wikis, project trackers, linked meeting notes. Overkill for personal use, but at work the structure pays off because everyone already has access.

              Conversational AI for thinking through problems, getting feedback, brainstorming. The key is <em>iterative dialogue</em>—going back and forth, correcting misunderstandings, building on previous responses.

          <h2>What I Don't Use</h2>
          <p>
            These tools didn't make the cut. The reason matters more than the tools themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><a href="https://usemotion.com">Motion</a></strong> "automatically schedules your tasks based on your energy levels." I already know when I work best. What I need is a calendar that stays out of my way—not another layer of automation making decisions for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><a href="https://getdex.com">Dex</a></strong> is a "relationship intelligence platform" that organizes contacts and suggests who to reach out to. What slows me down is remembering details—solved by discipline or simple notes, not a platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pattern: tools that <mark>add overhead</mark> while claiming to reduce it. They feel productive to configure. They don't solve anything.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Cost</h2>
          <p>
            Every tool has costs: setup time, learning curve, integration overhead, mental load. People see the marketing demo and imagine the upside. They don't account for the hours spent configuring it and the features they'll never touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before adopting any tool: <em>What problem does this solve that I have right now?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the answer requires reorganizing your workflow, the tool isn't solving your problem—it's creating one.
          </p>
