          Social media has become inundated with AI slop. a concept that was
          once developed for the intention of connecting, bringing together
          communities, and meeting new people is now filled with deepfakes, bad
          ai actors, and advertisements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The numbers tell a stark story. In just two years, AI-generated
          content on medium has surged from 1.8% to 37%. On Quora, the jump was
          sharper yet--from 2% to 39%. Meanwhile Google's AI Overviews now
          intercept nearly 40% of clicks that would have gone to other websites,
          with users increasingly likely to end their browsing sessions after
          seeing generated summaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          we aren't just living alongside ai anymore. we're living
          <mark>through it.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
          The conventional narrative frames this as competition—AI versus human
          creators, chatbots versus search engines, automation versus
          authenticity. But the real story is more troubling: AI isn't just
          creating content, it's becoming the intermediary that controls what
          information we consume. In this new landscape, independent websites
          and the "small web" aren't just nice to have—they're essential for
          preserving human connection and discovery in an increasingly mediated
          world.

        <h2>the intermediation</h2>
        <p>
          the mechanism is subtle but systematic. ai doesn't simply compete with
          human-created content, it intercepts and repackages it, keeping users
          within controlled ecosystems
